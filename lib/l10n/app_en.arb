I further understand that if I close the designated bank account, I will designate another bank account or make timely arrangements for payments to be made in another manner. This AutoPay authorization will remain in effect until I change my AutoPay elections (but I understand that any AutoPay transaction already in process at the time of any change made by me may still be completed), or until you send me a 15-day notice of cancellation of the AutoPay service.
